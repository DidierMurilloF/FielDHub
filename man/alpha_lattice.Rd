}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Number of  treatments.}

\item{k}{Size of incomplete blocks (number of units per incomplete block).}

\item{r}{Number of full blocks (or resolvable replicates) (also number of replicates per treatment).}

\item{l}{Number of locations. By default \code{l = 1}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for each location. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) String with names for each of the \code{l} locations.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with label list of treatments.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements.
\itemize{
  \item \code{infoDesign} is a list with information on the design parameters.
  \item \code{fieldBook} is a data frame with the alpha design field book.

\description{
Randomly generates an alpha design like \code{alpha(0,1)} across multiple locations.
