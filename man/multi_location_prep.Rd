Optimized multi-location partially replicated design

\examples{
# Example 1: Generates a spatially optimized multi-location p-rep design with 142 
# genotypes. The number of copies per plant available for this experiment is 9. 
# This experiment is carried out in 5 locations, and there are seven seeds available 
# for each plant to make replications.
# In this case, we add three controls (checks) with six reps each.
# With this setup, the experiment will have 142 treatments + 3 checks = 145 
# entries and the number of plots per location after the allocation process 
# will be 196. 
# The average genotype allocation will be 1.5 copies per location.
