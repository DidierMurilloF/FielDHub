\title{Generates a Resolvable Incomplete Block Design}
\usage{
incomplete_blocks(
  t = NULL,
  k = NULL,
  r = NULL,
  l = 1,
  plotNumber = 101,
  locationNames = NULL,
  seed = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Number of  treatments.}

\item{k}{Size of incomplete blocks (number of units per incomplete block).}

\item{r}{Number of full blocks (or resolvable replicates) (also number of replicates per treatment).}

\item{l}{Number of locations. By default \code{l = 1}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for each location. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) Names for each location.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with label list of treatments.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements.
\itemize{
  \item \code{infoDesign} is a list with information on the design parameters.
  \item \code{fieldBook} is a data frame with the incomplete block design field book.

\description{
Randomly generates a resolvable incomplete block design (IBD) of characteristics (t, k, r).
The randomization can be done across locations.

\examples{
# Example 1: Generates a resolvable IBD of characteristics (t,k,r) = (12,4,2).
# 1-resolvable IBDs
