\description{
Randomly generates a spatial partially replicated (p-rep) design for single or multiple locations.
}
\details{
This function generates and optimizes a partially replicated (p-rep) experimental design for a 
given set of treatments and replication levels. The design is represented by a matrix and optimized 
using a pairwise distance metric. The function outputs various information about the optimized design 
including the field layout, replicated and unreplicated treatments, and pairwise distances between 
treatments. Note that the design generation needs the dimension of the field (number of rows and columns).

\examples{
# Example 1: Generates a spatial optimized partially replicated arrangement design in one 
# location with 335 genotypes for a field with dimensions 15 rows x 28 cols. 
# Note that there are 250 genotypes unreplicated (only one time), 85 genotypes replicated 
# two times, and three checks 8 times each.

# Example 2: Generates a spatial optimized partially replicated arrangement design with 492 
# genotypes in a field with dimensions 30 rows x 20 cols. Note that there 384 genotypes
