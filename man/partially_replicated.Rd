\description{
Randomly generates a spatial partially replicated design, where the distance 
between checks is maximized in such a way that each row and column have control plots. 
Note that design generation needs the dimension of the field (number of rows and columns).

\examples{
# Example 1: Generates a spatial optimized partially replicated arrangement design in one 
# location with 312 genotypes for a field with dimensions 15 rows x 28 cols. 
# Note that there are 250 genotypes unreplicated (only one time), 50 genotypes replicated 
# two times, and 10 genotypes replicated three times, and two checks 20 times each one.
