\title{Swap pairs in a matrix of integers}
\usage{
swap_pairs(X, starting_dist = 3, stop_iter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of integers.}

\item{starting_dist}{The minimum starting distance to enforce between pairs 
of occurrences of the same integer. Default is 3.}

\item{stop_iter}{The maximum number of iterations to perform. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{X}{The modified matrix.}
  \item{designs}{A list of all intermediate designs, starting from the input matrix.}
  \item{distances}{A list of all pair distances for each intermediate design.}
}
}
\description{
Modifies the input matrix X to ensure that the distance between 
any two occurrences of the same integer is at least min_dist, by swapping 
one of the occurrences with a random occurrence of a different integer that 
is at least min_dist away. Where min_dist starts with starting_dist = 3, and then 
increase it by 1 until the algorithm no longer converges.
}
\examples{
# Create a matrix X with the numbers 1 to 10 are twice and 11 to 50 are once.
# The matrix has 6 rows and 10 columns
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(sample(c(rep(1:10, 2), 11:50), replace = FALSE), ncol = 10)
X
# Swap pairs
B <- swap_pairs(X, starting_dist = 2)
B$X
B$designs
B$distances
