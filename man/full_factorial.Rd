}
\arguments{
\item{setfactors}{Numeric vector with levels of each factor.}

\item{reps}{Number of replicates (full blocks).}

\item{l}{Number of locations. By default \code{l = 1}.}

\item{type}{Option for CRD or RCBD designs. Values are \code{type =
1} (CRD) or \code{type = 2} (RCBD). By default \code{type = 2}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for
each location. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{continuous}{Logical for plot number continuous or not. By
default \code{continuous = FALSE}.}

\item{planter}{Option for \code{serpentine} or \code{cartesian} plot
arrangement. By default \code{planter = 'serpentine'}.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed
to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) Names for each location.}

\item{factorLabels}{(optional) If \code{TRUE} retain the levels
labels from the original data set otherwise, numeric labels will be
assigned. Default is \code{factorLabels =TRUE}.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with the labels of factors.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements.
\itemize{
  \item \code{infoDesign} is a list with information on the design parameters.
  \item \code{fieldBook} is a data frame with the full factorial field book.

It randomly generates a full factorial design across locations.
