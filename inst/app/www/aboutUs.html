                <p class="profile-p">I am the Head of the Department of Plant Sciences and barley breeder at North Dakota State University. 
                    The primary goal of my breeding project is to release and develop two-rowed and six-rowed malting barley varieties acceptable 
                    to barley producers in North Dakota, adjacent states, and the malting and brewing industry. I am also the leader of 
                    the Breeding Pipeline Database Managers team and I provide guidelines and support on the statistical analysis.  </p>
