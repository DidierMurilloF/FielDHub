      <h2> <span id="text-primary">About the App</span></h2>
      <p class="p-box">FielD·Hub is an R Shiny design of experiments (DOE) app created by 
        the NDSU Big Data Pipeline team that aids in the 
        creation of traditional and non-traditional augmented experiment designs, 
        including spatial trials with checks assigned to plots in a diagonal 
        arrangement across the field. Users of FielD·Hub are guided through an 
        interactive DOE platform that generates randomizations of field, laboratory, 
        and greenhouse experiments. Outputs from FielD·Hub include interactive field maps, 
        tables, and field books that can be extracted and saved. 
        <br><br>
        A novel feature of FielD·Hub is an option that generates simulated data for a response variable along with the randomization. This feature makes FielD·Hub suitable for classroom teaching purposes, where instructors can either use the graphical dynamic user interphase and/or use the formulas included in the R package for teaching R scripting courses.
   <!-- <br>
    <br>
        For field experiments with a strict spatial arrangement, it allows users to specify the dimensions of the field as row and columns, while controlling the percentage of check plots, and obtaining randomized field maps and field books that can be used directly as templates and input files for central databases. Features are built-in separate modules and you can start to discover the advantages of our tool as soon as you download the app!--></p>
