I am thrilled to announce the release of FielDHub v1.3.1, which is the culmination of dedicated effort and hard work. This updated version includes improvements and new features, including **sparse allocation**, **optimized multi-location p-rep**, and more. We are excited to share these new capabilities with our users.

#### Changelog

#### Shiny App

* Added a new module to generate **Sparse allocation**.

* Added a new module for generating **Optimized Multi-Location Partially Replicated (p-rep)**.

* Added **vignettes and help documentation** for all the new standard functions and modules; Sparse Allocations 
and Optimized Multi-Location Partially Replicated (p-rep) Designs in the app. 

* Renamed the **Partially Replicated** module to **Single and Multi-Location p-rep**

* Improved the usability of the field dimensions dropdown menu by reordering the options based on the absolute value of the difference between the number of rows and columns for each option. This affects unreplicated and partially replicated designs modules.

* Fixed issue: Upload data in the CRD module.


#### Standalone Functions in `FielDHub` Package

* Created the `do_optim()` function.

* Created the `sparse_allocation()` function.

* Created the `multi_location_prep()` function.

* Created the `pairs_distance()` function.

* Created the `swap_pairs()` function.

* Created the `search_matrix_values()` function.

* Added a new and better optimization process for the partially replicated (p-rep) designs.

* Code refactoring on the `diagonal_arrangement()` function.

* Fixed issue: Avoid cyclic reps in incomplete block designs when the number of treatments is square.

#### Acknowledgements
