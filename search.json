Sparse allocation can increase efficiency reduce number experimental units required, making cost-effective option. One standard method implementing sparse allocation plant breeding experiments incomplete block designs (IBD) (Edmondson 2020). following key points summarize advantages disadvantages sparse allocation (Montesinos-Lopez et al. 2022): Increased efficiency: using sparse allocation, breeders can evaluate large number genotypes treatments single experiment across multiple environments, can accelerate breeding program reduce time resources needed evaluation. Selection intensity: large number genotypes treatments evaluated sparse allocation experiments can increase genetic diversity breeding program increase chances identifying superior genotypes treatments. Cost-effective: Sparse allocation experiments generally less expensive compared fully replicated experiments since fewer experimental units needed. Less accurate predictions: limited number experimental units means estimates treatment effects less precise compared fully replicated designs.

Added vignettes help documentation standard functions modules available designs app. Added capability making multiple randomizations across different locations unreplicated, partially replicated, lattice, RCBD, factorial, split-plot, split-split-plot, strip-plot, IBD, RCD designs. Added capability produce heatmap visualizations simulated data experimental designs. Added action buttons copy save field maps field book outputs Excel. Added factorization options aid users creation randomizations mapping layouts unreplicated partially replicated designs. Previous version required users * mathematical calculation priori. Added filters search boxes field book tables. Updated UI/UX design home page. Grouped single diagonal arrangement, multiple diagonal arrangement, optimized arrangement augmented RCB designs one single module. Added action run button experimental designs prevent reactivity issues application. Improved standardized user experience features readability access. Improved error logging messages. Added features inform end-users utilization correct input data file formats associated metadata/columns, checking duplicate values input files, well data type verification. Added plot() method FielDHub package display field layout field book designs. Added additional field layout visualization/map options experimental designs. Previous version mapping options unreplicated p-rep designs. Added drop-menu display multiple layout mapping option shown entry number plot experimental designs. means, now can visualize randomization layout option locations input. Added option repeating whole entries/experiments unreplicated diagonal arrangement design multiple experiments (previously called decision blocks). Added check box feature Augmented RCB design allow creation nurseries option randomizing experimental entries . user decides leave option unchecked, checks randomized, experimental entries shown consecutive order. Added check box option RCB design allow continuous plot numbering independently rep block number. Previous version coded replication plot number (.e., 101 =rep1, 201=rep2, etc.). Fixed restriction RCBD mapping layout allow use 25 entries.
